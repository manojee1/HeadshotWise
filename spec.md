# Professional Headshot AI App - Specification

## Overview
A web application that allows users to upload their photo and generate professional headshots using AI. Users can select from three distinct styles and compare the generated result with their original photo side-by-side.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Photo Upload**

   - image dimension validation (minimum 512x 512 px)
   - File size limits (max 10MB)

2. **Style Selection**
   - Three predefined professional styles:
     - **Corporate Classic**: Traditional business headshot, neutral background, formal lighting
     - **Creative Professional**: Modern dynamic styling, artistic background, contemporary lighting
     - **Executive Portrait**: Premium, formal styling, sophisticated lighting 

3. **AI Processing**
   - Integration with Google's nano Banana API https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation
   - loading state during processing
   - Error handling for API failures
   - Processing time estimation display

4. **Photo Comparison**
   - Side-by-side view of original vs. generated headshot
   - High-resolution output (minimum 1024x1024)

5. **Download and Export**
   - Download options for generated headshot in high resolution
   - Multiple formats (jpeg,png)
   - metadata preservation where applicable

### User Experience

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: UI Setup and Core Interface (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Create a fully functional user interface with all core components

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Project setup with React + TypeScript + Vite
- [ ] Responsive layout with header, main content area, and footer
- [ ] Photo upload component with drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Style selection interface with three style cards
- [ ] Image preview and comparison layout (placeholder for generated image)
- [ ] Loading states and basic error handling
- [ ] Download functionality for generated images
- [ ] Basic styling with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Form validation and user feedback
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design

**Technical Tasks**:
- Set up development environment and build pipeline
- Create reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal, etc.)
- Implement file upload with validation
- Design and implement the comparison view
- Add basic animations and transitions
- Set up routing (if needed for multiple pages)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can upload images successfully
- All three style options are clearly presented
- Interface works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- Loading states provide clear feedback
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable

### Milestone 2: AI Integration and Backend (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Integrate Google's nano banana API and create the backend infrastructure

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Express.js backend setup with TypeScript
- [ ] File upload endpoint with Multer
- [ ] Google Gemini API integration
- [ ] Image preprocessing and optimization
- [ ] API error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Rate limiting and security measures
- [ ] Temporary file storage and cleanup
- [ ] Frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Real-time processing status updates
- [ ] Production deployment configuration

**Technical Tasks**:
- Set up Express server with proper middleware
- Implement Google Gemini API client
- Create image processing pipeline
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement file storage and cleanup
- Set up environment variables and configuration
- Add API documentation
- Create deployment scripts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can successfully generate headshots using AI
- Processing times are reasonable (< 30 seconds)
- Generated images match the selected style
- System handles API failures gracefully
- All uploaded files are properly cleaned up
- Application is ready for production deployment

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Image processing completes within 30 seconds
- **Quality**: Generated headshots maintain facial features while applying style
- **Usability**: Users can complete the entire flow without confusion
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate for image generation
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning

## Future Enhancements
- Additional style options
- Batch processing for multiple images
- Custom style parameters
